# Adversarial ML Threat Matrix

## Things to keep in mind before you use the framework:
1.  This is a **first cut attempt** at collating known adversary techniques against ML Systems. We plan to iterate on the framework based on feedback from the security     and adversarial machine learning community (please engage with us and help make the matrix better!). Note: This is a *living document* that will be routinely updated.
   -  Have feedback or improvements? We want it! See [Feedback](/readme.md#feedback-and-getting-involved).
2.  Only known bad is listed in the Matrix. Adversarial ML is an active area of research with new classes constantly being discovered. If you find a technique that is     not listed, please enlist it in the framework (see section on [Feedback](/readme.md#feedback-and-getting-involved)).
3.  We are not prescribing definitive defenses at this point since the field has not reached consensus. We are already in conversations with industry members to add best practices in future revisions such as adversarial training for adversarial examples, restricting the number of significant digits in confidence score for model stealing.
4.  This is not a risk prioritization framework - The Threat Matrix only collates the known techniques; it does not provide a means to prioritize the risks.

## Structure of Adversarial ML Threat Matrix
Because the Adversarial ML Threat Matrix is fashioned after [ATT&CK Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/), it retains the terminologies: for instance, the column heads of the Threat Matrix are called "Tactics" and the individual entities are called "Techniques".

However, there are two main differences:

1.  ATT&CK Enterprise is generally designed for corporate network which is composed of many sub components like workstation, bastion hosts, database, network gear,         active directory, cloud component and so on. The tactics of ATT&CK enterprise (initial access, persistence, etc) are really a short hand of saying initial access       to *corporate network;* persistence *in corporate network.* In Adversarial ML Threat Matrix, we acknowledge that ML systems are part of corporate network but           wanted to highlight the uniqueness of the attacks.

    **Difference:** In the Adversarial ML Threat Matrix, the "Tactics" should be read as "reconnaissance of ML subsystem", "persistence in ML subsystem", "evading the      ML subsystem".

2.  When we analyzed real-world attacks on ML systems, we found out that attackers can pursue different strategies: Rely on traditional cybersecurity technique only;       Rely on Adversarial ML techniques only; or Employ a combination of traditional cybersecurity techniques and ML techniques.

    **Difference:** In Adversarial ML Threat Matrix, "Techniques" come in two flavors:
     -  Techniques in orange are specific to ML systems
     -  Techniques in white are applicable to both ML and non-ML systems and come directly from Enterprise ATT&CK

        Note: The Adversarial ML Threat Matrix is not yet part of the ATT&CK matrix.

## Adversarial ML Matrix - Description

### Reconnaissance


#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Acquire OSINT Information

Adversaries may leverage publicly available information, or Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), about an organization that could identify where or how machine learning is being used in a system, and help tailor an attack to make it more effective. These sources of information include technical publications, blog posts, press releases, software repositories, public data repositories, and social media postings.

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)ML Model Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to identify machine learning pipelines that exist on the system and gather information about them, including the software stack used to train and deploy models, training and testing data repositories, model repositories, and software repositories containing algorithms. This information can be used to identify targets for further collection, exfiltration, or disruption, or to tailor and improve attacks. 

> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Reveal ML Ontology
> By ML ML Ontology, we are referring to specific components of the ML system such as dataset (image, audio, tabular, NLP), features (handcrafted or learned), model / learning algorithm (gradient based or non-gradient based), parameters / weights. Depending on how much information is known, it can be a greybox or whitebox level of attacker knowledge. 
> 
>
> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Reveal ML Model Family
> Here the specifics of ML Models are not known and can generally be thought of as blackbox attacks. The attacker is able to only glean the model task, model input and model output. But because of the nature of the blog posts or papers that are published, some mention of the algorithms such as "Deep Learning" may squarely indicate that the underlying algorithm is gradient based.  


#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Gathering Datasets

Adversaries may collect datasets similar to those used by a particular organization or in a specific approach. Datasets may be identified when [Acquiring OSINT Information](#Acquire-OSINT-Information). This may allow the adversary to replicate a private model's functionality, constituting Intellectual Property Theft, or enable the adversary to carry out other attacks such as an [Evasion Attack](#Evasion-Attack).

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Exploit Physical Environment

In addition to the attacks that take place purely in the digital domain, adversaries may also exploit the physical environment for their attacks. Recent work has show successful false positive and evasion attacks using physically printed patterns that are placed into scenes to disrupt and attack machine learning models. MITRE has recently created a dataset based on these [physically printed patterns](https://apricot.mitre.org/) to help researchers and practitioners better understand these attacks.

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Model Replication

An adversary may replicate a model's functionality by training a shadow model by exploiting its API, or by leveraging pre-trained weights.

> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Exploit API - Shadow Model 
>
> An adversary may replicate a machine learning model's functionality by exploiting its inference API. In this case of model replication, the attacker repeatedly queries the victim's inference API and uses it as an oracle to collect combination of data and label. From the combination of (data,label), the attacker builds a shadow model, that effectively functions as the victim model -- but with lower fidelity. This is generally the first step in model evasion. 
>
> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Alter Publicly Available, Pre-Trained Weights
>
> An adversary uses pre-trained weights of one model to replicate a related model's functionality. For instance, researchers wanted to replicated GPT-2, a large language model. So, the researchers used the pre-trained weights of Grover, another NLP model, and modified it using GPT-2's objective function and training data, which effectively resulted in a shadow GPT-2 model (though with lower fidelity).

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Model Stealing

Machine learning models' functionality can be stolen exploiting an inference API. There is a difference between Model Extraction and Model Replication: in model extraction attacks, the attacker is able to build a shadow model whose fidelity matches that of the victim model and hence, model stealing/extraction attacks lead to Stolen Intellectual Property. In [Model Replication](#Model-Replication) attacks, the shadow model does not have the same fidelity as that of the victim model. 

### Initial Access

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Pre-Trained ML Model with Backdoor

Adversaries may gain initial access to a system by compromising portions of the ML supply chain. This could include GPU hardware, data and its annotations, parts of the ML software stack, or the model itself. In some instances the attacker will need secondary access to fully carry out an attack using compromised components of the supply chain.

### ![Cyber](/images/color_cyber.png) Included ATT&CK Techniques
<details>
<summary>Exploit Public-Facing Application</summary>

Adversaries may attempt to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability. These applications are often websites, but can include databases (like SQL)(Citation: NVD CVE-2016-6662), standard services (like SMB(Citation: CIS Multiple SMB Vulnerabilities) or SSH), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services.(Citation: NVD CVE-2014-7169) Depending on the flaw being exploited this may include [Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211).

If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud APIs or to take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.

For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.(Citation: OWASP Top 10)(Citation: CWE top 25)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Valid Accounts</summary>

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise. (Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Phishing</summary>

Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spear phishing. In spear phishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.

Adversaries may send victim’s emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems or to gather credentials for use of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078). Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms.
</details>

<details>
<summary>External Remote Services</summary>

Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006/) can also be used externally.

Access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network. Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Trusted Relationship</summary>

Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship exploits an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.

Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such, [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.
</details>

### Execution
#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Execute Unsafe ML Models

An Adversary may utilize unsafe ML Models that when executed have an unintended effect. The adversary can use this technique to establish persistent access to systems. These models may be introduced via a [Pre-Trained Model with Backdoor](#Pre-Trained-ML-Model-with-Backdoor).

> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)ML Models from Compromised Sources
>
> TIn Model Zoo such as "Caffe Model Zoo" or "ONNX Model Zoo" a collection of state of the art ML, pre-trained ML models are available so that ML engineers do not have to spend resources training ML models from scratch (hence "pre-trained"). An adversary may be able to compromise the model by checking in malicious code into the repository or perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack as the models are downloaded.  
>
> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Pickle Embedding
>
> Python is one of the most commonly used ML language. Python pickles are used in serializing and de-serializing a Python object structures. ML models are sometimes stored as pickles and shared. An adversary may use pickle embedding to introduce malicious data payloads which may result in remote code execution.

### ![Cyber](/images/color_cyber.png) Included ATT&CK Techniques
<details>
<summary>Execution via API</summary>
For most Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), the primary interaction point is via an API. So, attackers interact with the API in three ways: To build an offline copy of the model through Model Stealing or Model Replication; or to do online attacks like Model Inversion, Online Evasion, Membership inference. Execution via API is also possible for causative attacks if the adversary can taint the training data of the model via feedback loop, 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Traditional Software Attacks</summary>
All ML models exist in code, and thus vulnerable to "traditional software attacks" if the underlying system is not secured appropriately. For instance, [researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11008) found that a number of popular ML dev packages like Tensorflow, Caffe, OpenCV had open CVEs against them, making them vulnerable to traditional heap overflow and buffer overflow attacks. 
   
   
</details>

### Persistence
#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Execute unsafe ML Model Execution

An Adversary may utilize unsafe ML Models that when executed have an unintended effect. The adversary can use this technique to establish persistent access to systems. These models may be introduced via a [Pre-trained Model with Backdoor](#Pre-Trained-ML-Model-with-Backdoor). An example of this technique is to use pickle embedding to introduce malicious data payloads.
#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Enhance persistence of Backdoor

The common backdoored model is easy to fail in transfer learning, knowledge distillation and other learning paradigms, which means that the backdoor is no longer valid. In order to obtain the persistence of backdoors in downstream tasks, Adversaries may adopt novel methods of planting backdoors, such as [Latent Backdoor](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~huiyingli/publication/fr292-yaoA.pdf), [Progammable Backdoor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07766.pdf), [Anti-Distillation Backdoor](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3474085.3475254).
### ![Cyber](/images/color_cyber.png) Included ATT&CK Techniques
<details> 
<summary>Account Manipulation</summary>
Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials. In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Implant Container Image</summary>
Adversaries may implant cloud container images with malicious code to establish persistence. Amazon Web Service (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMI), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored. Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image.(Citation: Rhino Labs Cloud Image Backdoor Technique Sept 2019)

A tool has been developed to facilitate planting backdoors in cloud container images.(Citation: Rhino Labs Cloud Backdoor September 2019) If an attacker has access to a compromised AWS instance, and permissions to list the available container images, they may implant a backdoor such as a [Web Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003).(Citation: Rhino Labs Cloud Image Backdoor Technique Sept 2019) Adversaries may also implant Docker images that may be inadvertently used in cloud deployments, which has been reported in some instances of cryptomining botnets.(Citation: ATT Cybersecurity Cryptocurrency Attacks on Cloud)
</details>

### Evasion

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Evasion Attack

Unlike poisoning attacks that needs access to training data, adversaries can fool an ML classifier by simply corrupting the query to the ML model. More broadly, the adversary can create data inputs that prevent a machine learning model from positively identifying the data sample. This technique can be used to evade an ML model to correctly classify it in the downstream task. 


> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Offline Evasion
> In this case, the attacker has an offline copy of the ML model that was obtained via Model Replication or Model Extraction - depending on the case, the offline copy may be a shadow copy or a faithful reconstruction of the original model. While the goal of the adversary is to evade an online model, having access to an Offline model provides a space for the attacker to evade ML model without the fear of tripwires. Once the sample that evades the ML model is found, the attacker can essentially replay the sample to the victim, online model and be successful in the operation. 

> Now this asks the question - how can an an adversary find the sample algorithmically that evades the offline ML model? There are many strategies at play, and depending on the economics, the attacker may choose one from the following: Simple Transformation of the input (cropping, shearing, translation), Common Corruption (adding white noise in the background), Adversarial Examples (carefully perturbing the input to achieve desired output) and Happy String (wherein the benign input is tacked onto malicious query points). 
>
> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Online Evasion
>
> The same sub techniques like Simple Transformation, Common Corruption, Adversarial Examples, Happy Strings work also in the context of Online evasion attacks. The distinction between Offline and Online is if the model under attack is either stolen/replicated or if it is the live ML model. 

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Model Poisoning

Adversaries can train machine learning models that are performant, but contain backdoors that produce inference errors when presented with input containing a trigger defined by the adversary. A model with a backdoor can be introduced by an innocent user via a [pre-trained model with backdoor](#Pre-Trained-ML-Model-with-Backdoor) or can be a result of [Data Poisoning](#Data-Poisoning). This backdoored model can be exploited at inference time with an [Evasion Attack](#Evasion-Attack).

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Data Poisoning

Adversaries may attempt to poison datasets used by a ML system by modifying the underlying data or its labels. This allows the adversary to embed vulnerabilities in ML models trained on the data that may not be easily detectable. The embedded vulnerability can be activated at a later time by providing the model with data containing the trigger. Data Poisoning can help enable attacks such as [ML Model Evasion](#Evasion-Attack).

> ###### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Tainting Data from Acquisition - Label Corruption
>
> Adversaries may attempt to alter labels in a training set causing the model to misclassify.  
>
> ###### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Tainting Data from Open Source Supply Chains
>
> Adversaries may attempt to add their own data to an open source dataset which could create a classification backdoor.  For instance, the adversary could cause a targeted misclassification attack only when certain triggers are present in the query; and perform well otherwise. 
>
> ###### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Tainting Data from Acquisition - Chaff Data
>
> Adding noise to a dataset would lower the accuracy of the model, potentially making the model more vulnerable to misclassifications. For instance, researchers showed how they can overwhelm Splunk (and hence the ML models feeding from it), by simply adding potentially corrupted data. See [Attacking SIEM with Fake Logs](https://letsdefend.io/blog/attacking-siem-with-fake-logs/)
>
> ###### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Tainting Data in Training - Label Corruption
>
> Changing training labels could create a backdoor in the model, such that a malicious input would always be classified to the benefit of the adversary. For instance, the adversary could cause a targeted misclassification attack only when certain triggers are present in the query; and perform well otherwise. 

### Exfiltration

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Exfiltrate Training Data

Adversaries may exfiltrate private information related to machine learning models via their inference APIs. Additionally, adversaries can use these APIs to create copy-cat or proxy models.

> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Membership Inference Attack
>
> The membership of a data sample in a training set may be inferred by an adversary with access to an inference API. By simply querying the inference API of the victim model strategically -- and no extra access -- the adversary can cause privacy violations. 
>
> ##### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)ML Model Inversion
>
> Machine learning models' training data could be reconstructed by exploiting the confidence scores that are available via an inference API. By simply querying the inference API strategically, an adversary could back out potentially private information  embedded within the training data. This could lead to privacy violations if the attacker can reconstruct the data of sensitive features used in the algorithm. 

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)ML Model Stealing

Machine learning models' functionality can be stolen exploiting an inference API. There is a difference between Model Extraction and Model Replication: in model extraction attacks, the attacker is able to build a shadow model whose fidelity matches that of the victim model and hence, model stealing/extraction attacks lead to [Stolen Intellectual Property](#Stolen-Intellectual-Property). In Model Replication attacks, shown above, the shadow model does not have the same fidelity as that of the victim model. 

#### ![Cyber](/images/color_cyber.png) Included ATT&CK Techniques
<details> 
<summary>Insecure Storage</summary>

Adversaries may exfiltrate proprietary machine learning models or private training and testing data by exploiting insecure storage mechanisms. Adversaries may [discover](#ML-Model-Discovery), and exfiltrate components of a ML pipeline, resulting in Stolen Intellectual Property

</details>

### Impact

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Defacement

Adversaries can create data inputs that can be used to subvert the system for fun. This can be acheived corrupting the training data via poisoning as in the case of defacement of [Tay Bot](/pages/case-studies-page.md#tay-poisoning), Evasion or exploiting open CVEs in ML dev packages. 

#### ![AdvML](/images/color_advml.png)Denial of Service

Adversaries may target different Machine Learning services to conduct a DoS. One example of this type of attack is [Sponge examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03463) that could cause DoS on production NLP systems by wasting its energy consumption. 

#### ![Cyber](/images/color_cyber.png) Included ATT&CK Techniques
<details>
<summary>Stolen Intellectual Property</summary>

Adversaries may steal intellectual property by [Model Replication](#ML-Model-Replication) or [Model Stealing](#ML-Model-Stealing).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Data Encrypted for Impact</summary>

Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.(Citation: US-CERT Ransomware 2016)(Citation: FireEye WannaCry 2017)(Citation: US-CERT NotPetya 2017)(Citation: US-CERT SamSam 2018) In the case of ransomware, it is typical that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio, text, and source code files will be encrypted. In some cases, adversaries may encrypt critical system files, disk partitions, and the MBR.(Citation: US-CERT NotPetya 2017)

To maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for encrypting data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other attack techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).(Citation: FireEye WannaCry 2017)(Citation: US-CERT NotPetya 2017)
</details>

<details>

<summary>Stop System Shutdown/Reboot</summary>

Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems. Operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine. In some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer. Shutting down or rebooting systems may disrupt access to computer resources for legitimate users.

Adversaries may attempt to shutdown/reboot a system after impacting it in other ways, such as [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002/) or [Inhibit System Recovery] (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002/), to hasten the intended effects on system availability.
